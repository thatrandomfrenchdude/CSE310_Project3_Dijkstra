This Program is written in C++11 to compile on the general.asu.edu server.

This folder contains:
The Makefile, which is used to create the executable to run the project named run;
The main.cpp file and its header file, main.hpp, which is used to run the main body of the 		function;

The graph.cpp file and its header file, graph.hpp, which is used to run the graph 		functions and dijkstra’s algorithm. Graph.hpp contains the graph structure 		declarations.

The heap.cpp file and its header file, heap.hpp, which contains the heap functions 		necessary to run dijkstra’s algorithm. Heap.hpp also contains the struct 		declarations for the program;

The util.cpp file and its header file, util.hpp, which contains the heapify function and 	the function used to find the parent, left, and right indices of a given index;

The ReadMe file, which contains general information about the program.

In order to run the code, make the Makefile and run the executable.
